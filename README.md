# ARM-based-Recommender-System-for-Trustworthiness-with-Emotion-Recognition
Machine Learning Case Study


Overview:
Trustworthiness is the essence of a person or a thing which inspires reliability. As a human, trust is one of the most important things we care about. In recent years, the growing popularity of social media has resulted in making it a crucial platform for expressing emotions. People pour their heart out on social media for their opinions, secret feelings, overjoyed moments, thoughts that worry them or ideas which blows their mind off and the communication with each other through the text messages. Social media status, textual messages have become the most influential part of their life. This has resulted in the creation of a tremendous amount of user-generated content. But, there is no easy way to distinguish whether the content is trustworthy. A casual viewer might not be able to differentiate between trustworthy and untrustworthy content.
This work is focused on the problem of calibrating the value of shared content on social media with respect to its trustworthiness. In particular, the focus is on Emotion Recognition, the process of identifying human emotions and their relationship with each other by Association Rules. Social media applications (Twitter), Newspaper headlines and Articles data are going to be used in this case study. Ensemble Classifier, Random Forest Regressor and Association Rule Mining approach is proposed for this purpose. Frequent emotions identification step in which relevant emotions categories will be specified and suitable support and confidence will be identified. Then by Feature embedding, social media personâ€™s trustworthiness will be recognized.
